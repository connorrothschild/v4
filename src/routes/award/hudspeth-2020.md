Recipient of the Hudspeth Award in recognition of my seminar paper “[¡Vota! Testing the Impact of Spanish-Language Ballots on Election Results and Preferences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332470540_Vota_Testing_the_Impact_of_Spanish-Language_Ballots_on_Election_Results_and_Preferences).” The paper described an online experiment testing the impact of Spanish-language ballots on the policy preferences of white, monolingual English-speaking voters.
