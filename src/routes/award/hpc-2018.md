Awarded first place at Rice University’s inaugural Houston Centered Policy Design Competition. Judged by Houston Mayor Pro Tem Ellen Cohen; former president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston, Lee Wunsch; City Council at-large 2 representative, David Robinson; director of Rice’s Kinder Institute for Urban Research, Bill Fulton; and “flood czar” Stephen Costello.

My partner and I proposed an innovative, multi-home buyout system for the Meyerland community in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We recommended multi-home buyouts in order to address the “checkerboard effect” of home buyouts and also increase community solidarity. Awarded prize money and seed money for implementation.
