Awarded first place in the Rice Data to Knowledge Lab’s ‘COVID19 Houston Response Projects’ competition. My team’s project, "Mobility and Predictors of Movement During COVID-19," was a rigorous statistical analysis of how COVID19 impacted community movement, mobility, and social distancing. It took the form of a Shiny Web Application, where users could explore the effects of stay-at-home orders at reducing commnunity movement and COVID-19 transmission.
