[**The Race for Media Attention?**](https://observablehq.com/@connorrothschild/bar-chart-race) is an animated bar chart race depicting media mentions of Democratic presidential candidates during the 2020 presidential election. I made it before animated bar chart races were cool (and then [uncool](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1465770194170/reddits-dataisbeautiful-is-sick-of-bar-chart-races-so-its-banning-them)).

# Tools used

This project was built with [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). It was my first Observable notebook, and mostly an attempt to learn. (It was a fork of Mike Bostock's existing bar chart race.)
