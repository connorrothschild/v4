[**The Bob Ross Virtual Art Gallery**](https://connorrothschild.github.io/bob-ross-art-gallery/) is a visual storytelling piece analyzing Bob Ross' series _The Joy of Painting_. 

It allows the user to explore each painting from the series in an interactive, digital art gallery. It has attracted media attention from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/now/bob-ross-virtual-gallery-offers-195835693.html), [Nerdist](https://nerdist.com/article/bob-ross-virtual-gallery-art/), [OpenCulture](https://www.openculture.com/2021/06/the-bob-ross-virtual-art-gallery.html), [Fatherly](https://www.fatherly.com/play/bob-ross-virtual-art-gallery-perfect-relax/), [DesignTaxi](https://designtaxi.com/news/414284/Bob-Ross-Virtual-Art-Gallery-Lets-You-Take-A-Happy-Little-Break-To-See-His-Art/), [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2021/06/01/colors-of-bob-ross-explored/) and others. It also won first place in the Standalone Multimedia category at the Society for News Design's [2021 Student Design Contest](https://msusnd.org/2021-college-design-contest/).

# Tools used

I used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for all things visual and front-end. I used The Pudding's [Svelte Starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) which made configuration much easier, and made a lot of the visual aspects of the project less difficult to create (e.g. their `Window` component simplified resize events a ton).

For the scroll-based interactions, I used Russell Goldenberg's [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama). As of the creation of this project, there is no formal or official Svelte-based scrollytelling library. I therefore used Scrollama in its vanilla form, and plugged it into the Svelte component as if I were writing normal JavaScript.
